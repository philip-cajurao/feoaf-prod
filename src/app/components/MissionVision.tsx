          Our mission is to develop the next generation of entrepreneurs by
            providing real world business exposure that is not taught in schools
            to youth between 9 and 17 years old. We want to be an add-on, to
            teach kids and teens the things in the business world that arenâ€™t
            taught in academic settings.
