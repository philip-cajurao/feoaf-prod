            Our mission is to develop the next generation of entrepreneurs by
            providing real world business exposure that is not taught in schools
            to youth between 9 and 17 years old. We want to be an add-on, to
            teach kids and teens the things in the business world that arenâ€™t
            taught in academic settings.

          <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">Vision</h2>
          <p>
            As we continue to grow, our commitment remains steadfast in keeping
            pace with the developing needs of our kids and the organization and
            providing them with opportunities regardless of their age.
